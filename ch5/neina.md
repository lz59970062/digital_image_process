Yes, certainly. Here's how the given code can be expressed in LaTeX form, assuming $I$ as the original image and $N$ as the normalized output:

Convert the input image to 64-bit floating point format:

$I \rightarrow I_{64}$

Calculate local mean and local variance using a kernel of size $k$:

$M_{L} = \frac{1}{k^{2}}\sum\sum I_{64}(i, j)$

$V_{L} = \frac{1}{k^{2}}\sum\sum I_{64}(i, j)^{2}$

Where $(i, j)$ are the pixel positions within the kernel.

The actual local variance is calculated as:

$V_{L} = V_{L} - M_{L}^{2}$

Calculate the mean variance across the entire image:

$M_{V} = \frac{1}{W \times H}\sum\sum V_{L}$

Where $W$ and $H$ are the width and height of the image, respectively.

Normalize the variance of the image:

$N = \frac{V_{L} - M_{V}}{max(V_{L} - M_{V}) - min(V_{L} - M_{V})}$

This equation scales $V_{L} - M_{V}$ to the range 0 to 1.

The final output image is given by:

$O = M_{L} + N \cdot (I_{64} - M_{L})$

This is a basic representation of the code in LaTeX. The sum symbols are double to indicate that the sum is performed over both dimensions of the kernel, and I've made some assumptions on your original variable meanings.
